#### Typescript - Language
1. `typescript`: typescript module.

#### Webpack - Bundler
1. `webpack`: module bundler.
2. `webpack-cli`: webpack CLI provides a flexible set of commands for developers to increase speed when setting up a custom webpack project.
3. `webpack-dev-server`: Use webpack with a development server that provides live reloading. This should be used for development only.
4. `babel-loader`: Allows transpiling JavaScript files using Babel and webpack.
5. `css-loader`: Interprets @import and url() like import/require() and will resolve them.
6. `style-loader`: Inject CSS into the DOM.
7. `file-loader`: Resolves import/require() on a file into a url and emits the file into the output directory.
8. `url-loader`: A loader for webpack which transforms files into base64 URIs.
9. `html-loader`: Exports HTML as string. HTML is minimized when the compiler demands.
10. `html-webpack-plugin`: Plugin that simplifies creation of HTML files to serve your bundles

#### Babel - A free and open-source JavaScript transcompiler

3. `electron-store`: Simple data persistence for your Electron app or module - Save and load user preferences, app state, cache, etc.
4. `@electron/remote`: an Electron module that bridges JavaScript objects from the main process to the renderer process. This lets you access main-process-only objects as if they were available in the renderer process.
5. `electron-log`:  A Simple logging module for your Electron or NW.js application.

#### Three
1. `@react-three/fiber`: A React renderer for threejs.
2. `@types/three`: Threejs definition for typescript.

#### sqlite - FE DB.
1. `sql.js`: Javascript SQL database. It allows you to create a relational database and query it entirely in the browser.

#### ESLint
1. `eslint`:  Tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.
2. `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`: Typescript plugin for ESLint.
